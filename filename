Based on the provided document and the guidelines in Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 2 of the USCIS Policy Manual, the applicant, Kayode Tolu, would **not** be granted a visa. Here's a detailed reasoning based on the heuristic patterns you provided:

1. **Excessive generalizations or unquantified claims**: The application lacks specific details about the applicant's extraordinary abilities or outstanding contributions to their field. The form does not provide quantified evidence or specific examples of the applicant's exceptional work.

2. **Lack of independent third-party evidence**: There is no mention of independent third-party evidence, such as expert testimonials, awards, or media recognition, which are crucial for supporting claims of extraordinary ability or outstanding research.

3. **Template repetition across letters**: Although not explicitly shown in the provided document, if the applicant submits recommendation letters or other supporting documents, repetition and lack of personalization could indicate insufficient evidence.

4. **Field of expertise inconsistencies**: The application does not clearly define the applicant's field of expertise or how they have made significant contributions to it. The job title and description ( Part 6, Item 1 and 3) are left blank, which raises concerns about the applicant's actual role and responsibilities.

5. **Additional concerns**:
   - The application lacks critical information, such as the employer/petitioner's details (Part 5, Item 2-12).
   - The applicant did not clearly indicate the petition type (Part 2, Item 1.a. to 1.h.).
   - There is no mention of the labor certification or details about the job offer (Part 6, Item 8 and 9).

Given these inconsistencies, lack of evidence, and insufficient information, the applicant has not met the burden of proof required to establish eligibility for an immigrant visa in the categories mentioned in the application. Therefore, based on the provided information, the applicant would not be granted a visa. The application seems incomplete, and the applicant should provide more specific details and evidence to support their claims.
